/*TODO
1. create the food data(that your going to swipe on)
- set up the food constructor
- create instances of that constructor(eg: pizza, sushi, ect...)
- put it into the DOM

2. create a working dislike button
- just move to the next food / slide
- remove it from the list of food your being shown

3. create a working like button
- store the food in a data structure,
  so you can use that food data later
  (to find location to eat that food at)

4. create the results tab / get it working
- create the HTML / CSS
- show the all the(saved) food that they liked,
and location where they can order that food at
AND a recipe(s) that they can use to make that food themselves.
    - recipe can either be from youtube or a recipe api

Additional notes / features
    - when you have swiped through all the food,
    show a no more food left to show screen
